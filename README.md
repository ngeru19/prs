# Paper, scissors, rock, Spock and lizard game

Website with advanced version of the popular game. I first encountered its description while watching The Big Bang Theory.  

## Built with

It was built with usual suspects: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used React framework and Create React App for tools configuration.  

## Problems faced

- Was a little confused with state management, in some places the data flow was not as I expected;  
- I had to mess with responsiveness, because I had to synchronize three rows of divs with the background image, I need to see if there is a more reliable solution than manually;

## Lessons learned

- Keeping codebase structured and predictable is essential, sometimes get lost in my own code;
- Obtained some intuition on state management, but still have gaps, need to fill them up;

## Future updates

- Need to add some intermediate phase between choosing and announcing the winner;
- Maybe add optionality to choose between classical game and advanced version;
